/*
 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files
 * listed below.
 *
 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,
 * or vendor/assets/stylesheets of plugins, if any, can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the
 * compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any styles
 * defined in the other CSS/SCSS files in this directory. It is generally better to create a new
 * file per style scope.
 *
 * mfnote: require-tree and require-self are ral directives, not comments. require_tree says to pull all css files from the tree. 
 *         require_self directs the fx to make sure that any css in this file ends up at the browser also. 
 *         This is also a manifest and can contain a list of css files located wherever to also be included.
